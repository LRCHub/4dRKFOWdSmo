Look at all I'm leaving behind
They say that I'm the Jedi of fools
And I don't care if you're changing your mind
Everybody's gotta be cool

I see you run for your life
In the other direction
Don't look around
Or you'll give it away
Run for your life
There's a movie that's playing
I don't mean to say it
They tell me you're running

You're running out of time
You better get your head back in the place
A mountain to climb
And everything is there for you to take
You're running out of time
Are you gonna play the win or loser game
I'm good I'm alive, oh oh
You're running out of time

There's no time like the time that we had
It's crazy how you turn on a dime
And damn what's left that your money can't buy
I'm laughing cause the run that we had

Made ya run for your life
In a wide open canyon
Caught looking down
Yeah you see I'm ok
Run for your life
While the music is playing
Ain't nobody staying
They tell me you're running

You're running out of time
You better get your head back in the place
A mountain to climb
And everything is there for you to take
You're running out of time
Are you gonna play the win or loser game
I'm good I'm alive, oh oh
You're running out of time

I should be grateful, yes I know
So you tell me
And it's getting late and I should go
Oh oh yeah
You say you want me
I know you told me
I know you love me yeah

You're running out of time
You better get your head back in the place
A mountain to climb
And everything is there for you to take
You're running out of time
Are you gonna play the win or loser game
I'm good I'm alive, oh oh
You're running out of time
