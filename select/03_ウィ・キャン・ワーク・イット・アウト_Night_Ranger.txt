Something tells me
You're living with your past
Running in circles
Where is the point of that

I don't wanna be the
One to tell you that your
Little world is coming crashing down
I never thought I'd be the one
With my feet on the ground
Hear the sound

Let's just stop talking about it
We can work it out
Let's just stop talking about it
We can work it out

Something tells me
You're living way too fast
It's all well and fine
If you can hide it with your past

I don't wanna be the
One to tell you that your
Sky is falling everywhere around you
I never thought I'd be the one
Still hanging around
Hear the sound

Let's just stop talking about it
We can work it out
Let's just stop thinking about it
We can work it out
No need to worry about it
We can work it out
Let's just stop talking about it
We can work it out

We can work it out
We can work it out

Something tells me
We're living way too fast

Let's just stop talking about it
We can work it out
Let's just stop thinking about it
We can work it out
No need to worry about it
We can work it out
Let's just stop talking about it
We can work it out
