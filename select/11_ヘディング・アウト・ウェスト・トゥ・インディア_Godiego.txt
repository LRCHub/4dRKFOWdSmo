Me and my buddies
We're going, on a trip
We're a crazy lot
But boy ain't we hip

We got the power
To beat anyone
We got a dream
To give to everyone Ah Ha Ah Ha

Our super magic
It will do the trick
It'll be so easy yeah
To change them quick

We're in for danger
At every corner
But they don't know
Our super power Ah Ha Ah Ha

We're heading out west to India
There's sacred treasure we can find
We're heading out west to India
We're heading out west to India
And it's a long way there
