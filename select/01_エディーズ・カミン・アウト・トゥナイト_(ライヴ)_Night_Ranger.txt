He wears his trousers real tight
And his skin is so white
He lives beyond his means
He wear Italian shoes
That are used to good news
They walk behind the scenes
He live a tenderloin life
The street's his type
In the alley's where he's king
He got a grin on his face
He says he loves the rat race
He always plays to win
Eddie's coming out tonight
He like to rock (he rock it all night long)
He like to roll (oh yeah)
He like to rock (he rock it all night long)
He like to roll
He live a tale of two cites
Got a girl that looks pretty
She dresses for the rain
She doesn't care for a halo
She never ever says no
She's so insane
They like a late night madness
To break through the silence
You hear their mama's cry
The say tonight's the night
They're gonna cut you to your limit
Tonight you'll live or you'll die
Eddie's coming out tonight
He like to rock (he rock it all night long)
He like to roll (oh yeah)
He like to rock (he rock it all night long)
He like to roll (oh...)
He like to rock (rock! he rock it all night long)
He like to roll (he rolls he rolls)
He like to rock (rock! he rock it all night long)
He like to roll (oh...)
